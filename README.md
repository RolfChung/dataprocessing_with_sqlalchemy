# Summary: <br>data processing with SQLAlchemy

<p>
The first part of this project SQLAlchemy is used to import the database data with the Sqlite adapter into Pandas dataframes. Several methods for this purpose are explored. The second part of this 
project is applying queries to the Northwind-data. Several 
options of SQL are explored. A particular focus is set on joining of tables.
